# Assignment for Fault-localization

## Task1: Install Maven and Ant, and follow the instruction to install a Tarantula tool

Already done on the class and sign my name on don't-need-to-screenshot paper.

## Task2: Run the demo program, and write the code to visualize the result

So here is the graph that I didn't implement the **brightness** just for clearify which lines are colored and which are not:

After I implement the brightness, some lines are extremely light and almost unable to see the actual color, I just want to claim that this thing is really implement.

Also, I double the brightness for all the lines because the origin brightness is too light and almost all the lines can not be seen clearly. For those line which the number of brightness is bigger than 1, I set these targets to 1.
