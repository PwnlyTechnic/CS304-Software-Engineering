<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
When software is modified, during development and maintenance, it is
<var>regression tested</var> to provide confidence that the changes did
not introduce unexpected errors and that new features behave as expected.
One important problem in regression testing is how to select a subset of
test cases, from the test suite used for the original version of the
software, when testing a modified version of the software.
Regression-test-selection techniques address this problem. Safe
regression-test-selection techniques select every test case in the test
suite that may behave differently in the original and modified versions of
the software. Among existing safe regression testing techniques, efficient
techniques are often too imprecise and achieve little savings in testing
effort, whereas precise techniques are too expensive when used on large
systems. This paper presents a new regression-test-selection technique for
Java programs that is safe, precise, and yet scales to large systems. It
also presents a tool that implements the technique and studies performed
on a set of subjects ranging from 70 to over 500 KLOC. The studies show
that our technique can efficiently reduce the regression testing effort
and, thus, achieve considerable savings.
