<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We present a new, automatic technique to assess whether replacing a
component of a software system by a purportedly compatible component may
change the behavior of the system. The technique operates before
integrating the new component into the system or running system tests,
permitting quicker and cheaper identification of problems. It takes into
account the system's use of the component, because a particular component
upgrade may be desirable in one context but undesirable in another. No
formal specifications are required, permitting detection of problems due
either to errors in the component or to errors in the system. Both
external and internal behaviors can be compared, enabling detection of
problems that are not immediately reflected in the output. 
</p>

<p>
The technique generates an operational abstraction for the old component
in the context of the system and generates an operational abstraction for
the new component in the context of its test suite; an operational
abstraction is a set of program properties that generalizes over observed
run-time behavior. If automated logical comparison indicates that the new
component does not make all the guarantees that the old one did, then the
upgrade may affect system behavior and should not be performed without
further scrutiny. In case studies, the technique identified several
incompatibilities among software components.
