<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Explicitly stated program invariants can help programmers by
characterizing aspects of program execution and identifying program
properties that must be preserved when modifying code; invariants can also
be of assistance to automated tools. Unfortunately, these invariants are
usually absent from code. Previous work showed how to dynamically detect
invariants by looking for patterns in and relationships among variable
values captured in program traces. A prototype implementation, Daikon,
recovered invariants from formally-specified programs, and the invariants
it detected assisted programmers in a software evolution task. However, it
was limited to finding invariants over scalars and arrays. This paper
presents two techniques that enable discovery of invariants over richer
data structures, in particular collections of data represented by
recursive data structures, by indirect links through tables, etc. The
first technique is to traverse these collections and record them as arrays
in the program traces; then the basic Daikon invariant detector can infer
invariants over these new trace elements. The second technique enables
discovery of conditional invariants, which are necessary for reporting
invariants over recursive data structures and are also useful in their own
right. These techniques permit detection of invariants such as
&#8220;p.value &gt; limit or p.left in mytree&#8221;. The techniques are
validated by successful application to two sets of programs: simple
textbook data structures and student solutions to a weighted digraph
problem.
