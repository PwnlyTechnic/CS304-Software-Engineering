<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Formally verifying a program requires significant skill not only because
of complex interactions between program subcomponents, but also because of
deficiencies in current verification interfaces. These skill barriers make
verification economically unattractive by preventing the use of
less-skilled (less-expensive) workers and distributed workflows (i.e.,
crowdsourcing). 
</p>

<p>
This paper presents VeriWeb, a web-based IDE for verification that
decomposes the task of writing verifiable specifications into manageable
subproblems. To overcome the information loss caused by task
decomposition, and to reduce the skill required to verify a program,
VeriWeb incorporates several innovative user interface features: drag and
drop condition construction, concrete counterexamples, and specification
inlining. 
</p>

<p>
To evaluate VeriWeb, we performed three experiments. First, we show that
VeriWeb lowers the time and monetary cost of verification by performing a
comparative study of VeriWeb and a traditional tool using 14 paid subjects
contracted hourly from Exhedra Solution's vWorker online marketplace.
Second, we demonstrate the dearth and insufficiency of current ad-hoc
labor marketplaces for verification by recruiting workers from Amazon's
Mechanical Turk to perform verification with VeriWeb. Finally, we
characterize the minimal communication overhead incurred when VeriWeb is
used collaboratively by observing two pairs of developers each use the
tool simultaneously to verify a single program.
