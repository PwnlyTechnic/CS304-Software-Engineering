<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This work presents a technique to compute symbolic polynomial
approximations of the amount of dynamic memory required to safely execute
a method without running out of memory, for Java-like imperative programs.
We consider object allocations and deallocations made by the method and
the methods it transitively calls. More precisely, given an initial
configuration of the stack and the heap, the peak memory consumption is
the maximum space occupied by newly created objects in all states along a
run from it. We over-approximate the peak memory consumption using a
scoped-memory management where objects are organized in regions associated
with the lifetime of methods. We model the problem of computing the
maximum memory occupied by any region configuration as a parametric
polynomial optimization problem over a polyhedral domain and resort to
Bernstein basis to solve it. We apply the developed tool to several
benchmarks.
