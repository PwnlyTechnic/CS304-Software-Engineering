<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Ever scaling process technology makes embedded systems more vulnerable to
soft errors than in the past. One of the generic methods used to fight
soft errors is based on duplicating instructions either in the spatial or
temporal domain and then comparing the results to see whether they are
different. This full duplication based scheme, though effective, is very
expensive in terms of performance, power, and memory space. In this paper,
we propose an alternate scheme based on loop invariants and present
experimental results which show that our approach catches 62% of the
errors caught by full duplication, when averaged over all benchmarks
tested. In addition, it reduces the execution cycles and memory demand of
the full duplication strategy by 80% and 4%, respectively.
