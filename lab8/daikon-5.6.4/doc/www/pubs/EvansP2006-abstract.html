<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
One goal of introductory software engineering courses is to motivate and
instill good software engineering habits. Unfortunately, practical
constraints on typical courses often lead to student experiences that are
antithetical to that goal: instead of working in large teams and dealing
with changing requirements and maintaining programs over many years,
courses generally involve students working alone or in small teams with
short projects that end the first time the program works correctly on some
selected input. Small projects tend to reinforce poor software engineering
practices. Since the programs are small enough to manage cognitively in ad
hoc ways, effort spent more precisely documenting assumptions seems
wasteful. It is infeasible to carry out full industrial software
development within the context of a typical university course. However, it
is possible to simulate some aspects of safety critical software
engineering in an introductory software engineering course. This paper
describes an approach that focuses on thinking about and precisely
documenting invariants, and checking invariants using lightweight analysis
tools. We describe how assignments were designed to emphasize the
importance of invariants and to incorporate program analysis tools with
typical software engineering material and report on results from an
experiment measuring students understanding of program invariants.
