<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Concurrency is a requirement for much modern software, but the
implementation of multithreaded algorithms comes at the risk of errors
such as data races. Programmers can prevent data races by documenting and
obeying a locking discipline, which indicates which locks must be held in
order to access which data. 
</p>

<p>
This paper introduces a formal semantics for locking specifications that
gives a guarantee of race freedom. A notable difference from most other
semantics is that it is in terms of values (which is what the runtime
system locks) rather than variables. The paper also shows how to express
the formal semantics in two different styles of analysis: abstract
interpretation and type theory. We have implemented both analyses, in
tools that operate on Java. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
first tools that can soundly infer and check a locking discipline for
Java. Our experiments compare the implementations with one another and
with annotations written by programmers, showing that the ambiguities and
unsoundness of previous formulations are a problem in practice.
