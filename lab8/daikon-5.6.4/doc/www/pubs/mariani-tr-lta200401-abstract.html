<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Component-based system (CBS) technology facilitates flexibility: systems
can be adapted, modified, and updated by adding, removing, and changing
their components. Adding or modifying components require testing the
components added or modified as well as all components that depend from
them. Modifying components can introduce dangerous side effects that are
difficult to predict, thus, in principle, we need to retest the whole
system. Re-testing the whole system may be extremely expensive and
sometimes not even possible. Testing effort can be reduced by selecting a
subset of tests using either regression testing techniques (see for
instance, [RH97, JH03]) or dependence analysis techniques (see for
instance [SW01, SHR99]). Testing effort can also be reduced with run-time
verification techniques that can partially substitute traditional testing
(see for instance [HR02]). 
</p>

<p>
This work consists on a technique reducing testing costs for CBSs. The
approach, called Behavior Capture and Test (BCT), effectively combines
run-time monitoring, run-time verification, and testing. We use run-time
monitoring to gather data about single executions. The collected data are
then used to automatically derive behavioral properties of the components
and the system. The inferred properties are used for run-time
verification, while single executions are used as regression test cases.
BCT can be used to automatically verify the integration of components that
have been used in the same or in other systems, which is a very frequent
case in component-based development. 
</p>

<p>
In this report we focus on verification of component-based systems, thus
we will not address testing and automatic derivation of test suites.
