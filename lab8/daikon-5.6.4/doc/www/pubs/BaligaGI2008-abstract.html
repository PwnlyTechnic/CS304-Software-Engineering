<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Kernel-level rootkits affect system security by modifying key kernel data
structures to achieve a variety of malicious goals. While early rootkits
modified control data structures, such as the system call table and values
of function pointers, recent work has demonstrated rootkits that
maliciously modify non-control data structures. Prior techniques for
rootkit detection fail to identify such rootkits either because they focus
solely on detecting control data modifications or because they require
elaborate, manually-supplied specifications to detect modifications of
non-control data. 
</p>

<p>
This paper presents a novel rootkit detection technique that automatically
detects rootkits that modify both control and non-control data. The key
idea is to externally observe the execution of the kernel during a
training period and hypothesize invariants. These invariants are used as
specifications of data structure integrity during an enforcement phase;
violation of these invariants indicates the presence of a rootkit. 
</p>

<p>
We present the design and implementation of Gibraltar, a tool that uses
the above approach to infer and enforce invariants. In experiments, we
found that Gibraltar can detect rootkits that modify both control and
non-control data structures, and that its false positive rate and
monitoring overheads are negligible.
