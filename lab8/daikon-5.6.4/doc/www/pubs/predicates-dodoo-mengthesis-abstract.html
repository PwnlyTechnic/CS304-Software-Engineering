&#8220;Selecting Predicates for Conditional Invariant Detection Using
Cluster Analysis&#8221;

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This thesis proposes a new technique for selecting predicates for
conditional program invariants	&mdash;  that is, implications of the form
&#8220;p &rArr; q&#8221; whose consequent is true only when the predicate
is true. Conditional invariants are prevalent in recursive data
structures, which behave differently in the base and recursive cases, and
in many other situations. 
</p>

<p>
We argue that inferring conditional invariants in programs can be reduced
to the task of selecting suitable predicates from which to infer these
conditional invariants. It is computationally infeasible to try every
possible predicate for conditional properties, and therefore it is
necessary to limit possible predicates to only those likely to give good
results. This thesis describes the use of cluster analysis to select
suitable predicates for conditional invariant detection from program
execution traces. The primary thesis is: <var>if &#8220;natural&#8221;
clusters exist in the values of program execution traces, then invariants
over these clusters should serve as good predicates for conditional
invariant detection.</var> 
</p>

<p>
The conditional invariants inferred by cluster analysis can be useful to
programmers for a variety of tasks. In two experiments, we show that they
are useful in a static verification task and can help programmers identify
bugs in software programs, and we compare the results with other methods
for finding conditional invariants.
