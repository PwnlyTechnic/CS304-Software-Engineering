<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
During software evolution, information about changes between different
versions of a program is useful for a number of software engineering
tasks. For example, configuration-management systems can use change
information to assess possible conflicts among updates from different
users. For another example, in regression testing, knowledge about which
parts of a program are unchanged can help in identifying test cases that
need not be rerun. For many of these tasks, a purely syntactic
differencing may not provide enough information for the task to be
performed effectively. This problem is especially relevant in the case of
object-oriented software, for which a syntactic change can have subtle and
unforeseen effects. In this paper, we present a technique for comparing
object-oriented programs that identifies both differences and
correspondences between two versions of a program. The technique is based
on a representation that handles object-oriented features and, thus, can
capture the behavior of object-oriented programs.We also present JDiff, a
tool that implements the technique for Java programs. Finally, we present
the results of four empirical studies, performed on many versions of two
medium-sized subjects, that show the efficiency and effectiveness of the
technique when used on real programs.
