<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We present a static analysis for computing a parametric upper-bound of the
amount of memory dynamically allocated by (Java-like) imperative
object-oriented programs. We propose a general procedure for synthesizing
non-linear formulas which conservatively estimate the quantity of memory
explicitly allocated by a method as a function of its parameters. We have
implemented the procedure and evaluated it on several benchmarks.
Experimental results produced exact estimations for most test cases, and
quite precise approximations for many of the others. We also apply our
technique to compute usage in the context of scoped memory and discuss
some open issues.
