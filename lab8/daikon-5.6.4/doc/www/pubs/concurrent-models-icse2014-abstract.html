<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Concurrent systems are notoriously difficult to debug and understand. A
common way of gaining insight into system behavior is to inspect execution
logs and documentation. Unfortunately, manual inspection of logs is an
arduous process, and documentation is often incomplete and out of sync
with the implementation. 
</p>

<p>
To provide developers with more insight into concurrent systems, we
developed CSight. CSight mines logs of a system's executions to infer a
concise and accurate model of that system's behavior, in the form of a
communicating finite state machine (CFSM). 
</p>

<p>
Engineers can use the inferred CFSM model to understand complex behavior,
detect anomalies, debug, and increase confidence in the correctness of
their implementations. CSight's only requirement is that the logged events
have vector timestamps. We provide a tool that automatically adds vector
timestamps to system logs. Our tool prototypes are available at <a
href="https://github.com/ModelInference/synoptic">https://github.com/ModelInference/synoptic</a>. </p>

<p>
This paper presents algorithms for inferring CFSM models from traces of
concurrent systems, proves them correct, provides an implementation, and
evaluates the implementation in two ways: by running it on logs from three
different networked systems and via a user study that focused on bug
finding. Our evaluation finds that CSight infers accurate models that can
help developers find bugs.
