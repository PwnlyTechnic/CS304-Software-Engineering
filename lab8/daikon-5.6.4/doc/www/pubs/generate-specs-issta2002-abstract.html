<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Producing specifications by dynamic (runtime) analysis of program
executions is potentially unsound, because the analyzed executions may not
fully characterize all possible executions of the program. In practice,
how accurate are the results of a dynamic analysis? This paper describes
the results of an investigation into this question, determining how much
specifications generalized from program runs must be changed in order to
be verified by a static checker. Surprisingly, small test suites captured
nearly all program behavior required by a specific type of static
checking; the static checker guaranteed that the implementations satisfy
the generated specifications, and ensured the absence of runtime
exceptions. Measured against this verification task, the generated
specifications scored over 90% on precision, a measure of soundness, and
on recall, a measure of completeness. 
</p>

<p>
This is a positive result for testing, because it suggests that dynamic
analyses can capture all semantic information of interest for certain
applications. The experimental results demonstrate that a specific
technique, dynamic invariant detection, is effective at generating
consistent, sufficient specifications for use by a static checker.
Finally, the research shows that combining static and dynamic analyses
over program specifications has benefits for users of each technique,
guaranteeing soundness of the dynamic analysis and lessening the
annotation burden for users of the static analysis.
