<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper shows how to integrate two complementary techniques for
manipulating program invariants: dynamic detection and static
verification. Dynamic detection proposes likely invariants based on
program executions, but the resulting properties are not guaranteed to be
true over all possible executions. Static verification checks that
properties are always true, but it can be difficult and tedious to select
a goal and to annotate programs for input to a static checker. Combining
these techniques overcomes the weaknesses of each: dynamically detected
invariants can annotate a program or provide goals for static
verification, and static verification can confirm properties proposed by a
dynamic tool. 
</p>

<p>
We have integrated a tool for dynamically detecting likely program
invariants, Daikon, with a tool for statically verifying program
properties, ESC/Java. Daikon examines run-time values of program
variables; it looks for patterns and relationships in those values, and it
reports properties that are never falsified during test runs and that
satisfy certain other conditions, such as being statistically justified.
ESC/Java takes as input a Java program annotated with preconditions,
postconditions, and other assertions, and it reports which annotations
cannot be statically verified and also warns of potential runtime errors,
such as null dereferences and out-of-bounds array indices. 
</p>

<p>
Our prototype system runs Daikon, inserts its output into code as ESC/Java
annotations, and then runs ESC/Java, which reports unverifiable
annotations. The entire process is completely automatic, though users may
provide guidance in order to improve results if desired. In preliminary
experiments, ESC/Java verified all or most of the invariants proposed by
Daikon.
