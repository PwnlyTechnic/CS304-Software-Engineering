<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Theorem provers are notoriously hard to use because of the amount of human
interaction they require, but they are important tools that can verify
infinite state distributed systems. We present a method to make
theorem-proving safety properties of distributed algorithms more
productive by reducing human intervention. We model the algorithms as I/O
automata, render the automata executable, and analyze the test executions
with dynamic invariant detection. The human work in using a theorem prover
is reduced because our technique provides two forms of assistance: lemmas
generated by the dynamic invariant detection for use in the prover; and
prover scripts, or tactics, generated from our experience with the I/O
automaton model and the knowledge embedded in the test suite used for
execution. We test our technique on three case studies: the Peterson
2-process mutual exclusion algorithm, a strong caching implementation of
shared memory, and Lamport's Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus. 
</p>

<p>
In the development and implementation of our method, we also improved the
tools for formal verification of I/O automata and for dynamic invariant
detection. We describe a new model for specifying I/O automata in the
Isabelle theorem prover's logic, and prove the soundness of a technique
for verifying invariants in this model in the Isabelle prover. We develop
methods for generating proofs of I/O automata for two theorem provers, the
Larch Prover and Isabelle/HOL. We show methods for executing I/O automata
for testing, by allowing the execution of some automata defined with
universal and existential quantifiers that were previously non-executable.
Lastly, we present improvements to dynamic invariant detection in order to
make it more scalable | in particular, we show how to achieve efficient
incremental dynamic invariant detection, where the detection tool is only
allowed to make one pass over its input executions.
