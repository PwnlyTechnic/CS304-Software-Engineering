<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Dynamic detection of program invariants is emerging as an important
research area with many challenging problems. Generating suitable test
cases that support accurate detection of program invariants is crucial to
the dynamic approach for invariant detection. In this paper, we propose a
new structural coverage criterion called Invariant-coverage criterion for
dynamic detection of program invariants. We also show how the
invariant-coverage criterion can be used to improve the accuracy of
dynamically detected invariants. We first used the Daikon tool to report
likely program invariants using the branch coverage and all definition-use
pair coverage test suites for several programs. We then generated
invariant-coverage suites for these likely invariants. When Daikon was run
with the invariant-coverage suites, several spurious invariants reported
earlier by the branch coverage and definition-use pair coverage test
suites were removed from the reported invariants. Our approach also
produced more meaningful invariants than randomly generated test suites.
