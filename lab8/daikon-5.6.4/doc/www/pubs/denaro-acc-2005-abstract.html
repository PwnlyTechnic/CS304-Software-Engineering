<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Autonomic communication and autonomic computing can solve many problems in
managing complex network and computer systems, as well as network
applications, where computing and networking co-exist. Autonomic
applications must be able to automatically diagnose and repair their own
faults. In particular they must be able to monitor the execution state,
understand the behavior of the application and of the executing
environment, and interpret monitored data to identify faults and select a
repairing strategy. 
</p>

<p>
Assertions have been extensively studied in software engineering for
identifying deviations from the expected behaviors and thus signal
anomalous outcomes. Unfortunately, classic assertions are defined
statically at development time and cannot capture unpredictable changes
and evolutions in the execution environment. Thus they do not easily adapt
to autonomic applications. 
</p>

<p>
This paper proposes a method for the automatic synthesis and adaptation of
assertions from the observed behavior of an application, aimed at
achieving adaptive application monitoring. We believe that this represents
an important basis to derive autonomic mechanisms that can deal with
unpredictable situations.
