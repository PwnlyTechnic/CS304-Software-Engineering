<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Comparing behaviors of program versions has become an important task in
software maintenance and regression testing. Traditional regression
testing strongly focuses on black-box comparison of program outputs.
Program spectra have recently been proposed to characterize a program s
behavior inside the black box. Comparing program spectra of program
versions offers insights into the internal behavior differences between
versions. In this paper, we present a new class of program spectra, value
spectra, which enriches the existing program spectra family. We compare
the value spectra of an old version and a new version to detect internal
behavior deviations in the new version. We use a deviation-propagation
call tree to present the deviation details. Based on the
deviation-propagation call tree, we propose two heuristics to locate
deviation roots, which are program locations that trigger the behavior
deviations. We have conducted an experiment on seven C programs to
evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach can effectively
expose program behavior differences between versions even when their
program outputs are the same, and our approach reports deviation roots
with high accuracy for most programs.
