<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this thesis, I address the challenges of developing tools which use a
mixed-level approach to dynamic binary analysis. The mixed-level approach
combines advantages of both source-based and binary-based approaches to
dynamic analysis, but comes with the added challenge of dealing with the
implementation details of a specific implementation of the target
language. This thesis describes the implementation of three existing tools
which use the mixed-level approach: Fjalar, a C/C++ dynamic analysis
framework, Kvasir, A C/C++ value profiling tool, and Dyncomp, a tool for
inferring the abstract types of a C or C++ program. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this thesis describes the steps I took in increasing the
maintainability and portability of these tools. I investigated and
documented platform specific dependencies; I documented the process of
merging in upstream changes of Valgrind, the Dynamic Binary Instrumenter
Fjalar is built on, to aid Fjalar in keeping in-sync with Valgrind
bug-fixes; and I implemented a tool for debugging Dyncomp errors.
