<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Component-based software systems raise new problems for the testing
community: the reuse of components suggests the possibility of reducing
testing costs by reusing information about the quality of the software
components. This paper addresses the problem of testing evolving software
systems, i.e., systems obtained by modifying and/or substituting some of
their components. The paper proposes a technique to automatically identify
behavioral differences between different versions of the system, to deduce
possible problems from inconsistent behaviors. The approach is based on
the automatic distilling of invariants from in-field executions. The
computed invariants are used to monitor the behavior of new components,
and to reveal unexpected interactions. The event generated while
monitoring system executions are presented to software engineers who can
infer possible problems of the new versions.
