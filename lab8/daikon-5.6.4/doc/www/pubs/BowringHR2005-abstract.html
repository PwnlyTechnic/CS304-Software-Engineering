<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
One approach to the automatic classification of program behaviors is to
view these behaviors as the collection of all the program's executions.
Many features of these executions, such as branch profiles, can be
measured, and if these features accurately predict behavior, we can build
automatic behavior classifiers from them using statistical
machine-learning techniques. Two key problems in the development of useful
classifiers are (1) the costs of collecting and modeling data and (2) the
adaptation of classifiers to new or unknown behaviors. We address the
first problem by concentrating on the properties and costs of individual
features and the second problem by using the active-learning paradigm. In
this paper, we present our technique for modeling a data-flow feature as a
stochastic process exhibiting the Markov property. We introduce the novel
concept of databins to summarize, as Markov models, the transitions of
values for selected variables. We show by empirical studies that
databin-based classifiers are effective. We also describe ensembles of
classifiers and how they can leverage their components to improve
classification rates. We show by empirical studies that ensembles of
control-flow and data-flow based classifiers can be more effective than
either component classifier.
