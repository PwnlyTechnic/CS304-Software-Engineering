<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper proposes a technique for identifying program properties that
indicate errors. The technique generates machine learning models of
program properties known to result from errors, and applies these models
to program properties of user-written code to classify and rank properties
that may lead the user to errors. Given a set of properties produced by
the program analysis, the technique selects a subset of properties that
are most likely to reveal an error. 
</p>

<p>
An implementation, the Fault Invariant Classifier, demonstrates the
efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant
detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine
and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our
experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the
concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average
for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs. Preliminary experience
suggests that most of the fault-revealing properties do lead a programmer
to an error.
