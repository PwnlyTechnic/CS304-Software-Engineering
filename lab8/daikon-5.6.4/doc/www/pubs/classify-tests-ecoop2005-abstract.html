<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper describes a technique that selects, from a large set of test
inputs, a small subset likely to reveal faults in the software under test.
The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct
executions &mdash; say, from observations of the software running
properly, or from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance.
The technique first infers an operational model of the software's
operation. Then, inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs
from the model in specific ways are suggestive of faults. These inputs are
further reduced by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The
result is a small portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique
as most likely to reveal faults. Thus, the technique can also be seen as
an error-detection technique. 
</p>

<p>
The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input
selection. One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set
of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus
transforming the test input into a test case. The other is a
classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use
of operational models and patterns. When generating inputs, it filters out
code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving
the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs. 
</p>

<p>
We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates
unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and
an example program execution &mdash; say, a passing test suite. Eclat's
output is a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially
fault-revealing input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails.
In our experiments, Eclat successfully generated inputs that exposed
fault-revealing behavior; we have used Eclat to reveal real errors in
programs. The inputs it selects as fault-revealing are an order of
magnitude as likely to reveal a fault as all generated inputs.
