<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Software errors often occur at the interfaces between separately developed
components. Incompatibilities are an especially acute problem when
upgrading software components, as new versions may be accidentally
incompatible with old ones. As an inexpensive mechanism to detect many
such problems, previous work proposed a technique that adapts methods from
formal verification to use component abstractions that can be
automatically generated from implementations. The technique reports,
before performing the replacement or integrating the new component into a
system, whether the upgrade might be problematic for that particular
system. The technique is based on a rich model of components that support
internal state, callbacks, and simultaneous upgrades of multiple
components, and component abstractions may contain arbitrary logical
properties including unbounded-state ones. 
</p>

<p>
This paper motivates this (somewhat non-standard) approach to component
verification. The paper also refines the formal model of components,
provides a formal model of software system safety, gives an algorithm for
constructing a consistency condition, proves that the algorithm's result
guarantees system safety in the case of a single-component upgrade, and
gives a proof outline of the algorithm's correctness in the case of an
arbitrary upgrade.
