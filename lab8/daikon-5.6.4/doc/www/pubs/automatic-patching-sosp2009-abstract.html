<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We present ClearView, a system for automatically patching errors in
deployed software. ClearView works on stripped Windows x86 binaries
without any need for source code, debugging information, or other external
information, and without human intervention. 
</p>

<p>
ClearView (1) observes normal executions to learn invariants that
characterize the application's normal behavior, (2) uses error detectors
to monitor the execution to detect failures, (3) identifies violations of
learned invariants that occur during failed executions, (4) generates
candidate repair patches that enforce selected invariants by changing the
state or the flow of control to make the invariant true, and (5) observes
the continued execution of patched applications to select the most
successful patch. 
</p>

<p>
ClearView is designed to correct errors in software with high availability
requirements. Aspects of ClearView that make it particularly appropriate
for this context include its ability to generate patches without human
intervention, to apply and remove patches in running applications without
requiring restarts or otherwise perturbing the execution, and to identify
and discard ineffective or damaging patches by evaluating the continued
behavior of patched applications. 
</p>

<p>
In a Red Team exercise, ClearView survived attacks that exploit security
vulnerabilities. A hostile external Red Team developed ten code-injection
exploits and used these exploits to repeatedly attack an application
protected by ClearView. ClearView detected and blocked all of the attacks.
For seven of the ten exploits, ClearView automatically generated patches
that corrected the error, enabling the application to survive the attacks
and successfully process subsequent inputs. The Red Team also attempted to
make ClearView apply an undesirable patch, but ClearView's patch
evaluation mechanism enabled ClearView to identify and discard both
ineffective patches and damaging patches.
