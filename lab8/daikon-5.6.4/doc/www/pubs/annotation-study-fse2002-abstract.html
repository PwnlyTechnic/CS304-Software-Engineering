<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Static checking can verify the absence of errors in a program, but often
requires written annotations or specifications. As a result, static
checking can be difficult to use effectively: it can be difficult to
determine a specification and tedious to annotate programs. Automated
tools that aid the annotation process can decrease the cost of static
checking and enable it to be more widely used. 
</p>

<p>
This paper describes an evaluation of the effectiveness of two techniques,
one static and one dynamic, to assist the annotation process. We
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate 41 programmers using ESC/Java in
a program verification task over three small programs, using Houdini for
static inference and Daikon for dynamic inference. We also investigate the
effect of unsoundness in the dynamic analysis. 
</p>

<p>
Statistically significant results show that both inference tools improve
task completion; Daikon enables users to express more correct invariants;
unsoundness of the dynamic analysis is little hindrance to users; and
users imperfectly exploit Houdini. Interviews indicate that beginning
users found Daikon to be helpful; Houdini to be neutral; static checking
to be of potential practical use; and both assistance tools to have unique
benefits. 
</p>

<p>
Our observations not only provide a critical evaluation of these two
techniques, but also highlight important considerations for creating
future assistance tools.
