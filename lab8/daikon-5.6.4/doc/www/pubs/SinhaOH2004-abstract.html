<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Although object-oriented languages can improve programming practices,
their characteristics may introduce new problems for software engineers.
One important problem is the presence of implicit control flow caused by
exception handling and polymorphism. Implicit control flow causes complex
interactions, and can thus complicate software-engineering tasks. To
address this problem, we present a systematic and structured approach, for
supporting these tasks, based on the static and dynamic analyses of
constructs that cause implicit control flow. Our approach provides
software engineers with information for supporting and guiding development
and maintenance tasks. We also present empirical results to illustrate the
potential usefulness of our approach. Our studies show that, for the
subjects considered, complex implicit control flow is always present and
is generally not adequately exercised.
