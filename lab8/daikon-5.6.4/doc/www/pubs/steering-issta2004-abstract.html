<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A multi-mode software system contains several distinct modes of operation
and a controller for deciding when to switch between modes. Even when
developers rigorously test a multi-mode system before deployment, they
cannot foresee and test for every possible usage scenario. As a result,
unexpected situations in which the program fails or underperforms (for
example, by choosing a non-optimal mode) may arise. This research aims to
mitigate such problems by creating a new mode selector that examines the
current situation, then chooses a mode that has been successful in the
past, in situations like the current one. The technique, called program
steering, creates a new mode selector via machine learning from good
behavior in testing or in successful operation. Such a strategy, which
generalizes the knowledge that a programmer has built into the system, may
select an appropriate mode even when the original controller cannot. We
have performed experiments on robot control programs written in a
month-long programming competition. Augmenting these programs via our
program steering technique had a substantial positive effect on their
performance in new environments.
