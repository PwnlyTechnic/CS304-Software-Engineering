<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
One of the chief advantages of model checking is the production of
counterexamples demonstrating that a system does not satisfy a
specification. However, it may require a great deal of human effort to
extract the essence of an error from even a detailed source-level trace of
a failing run. We use an automated method for finding multiple versions of
an error (and similar executions that do not produce an error), and
analyze these executions to produce a more succinct description of the key
elements of the error. The description produced includes identification of
portions of the source code crucial to distinguishing failing and
succeeding runs, differences in invariants between failing and non-failing
runs, and information on the necessary changes in scheduling and
environmental actions needed to cause successful runs to fail.
