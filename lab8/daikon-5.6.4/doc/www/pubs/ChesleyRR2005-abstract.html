<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Crisp is a tool (i.e., an Eclipse plug-in) for constructing intermediate
versions of a Java program that is being edited in an IDE such as Eclipse.
After a long editing session, a programmer usually will run regression
tests to make sure she has not invalidated previously checked
functionality. If a test fails unexpectedly, Crisp uses input from
Chianti, a tool for semantic change impact analysis [8], to allow the
programmer to select parts of the edit that affected the failing test and
to add them to the original program, creating an intermediate version
guaranteed to compile. Then the programmer can re-execute the test in
order to locate the exact reasons for the failure by concentrating on
those affecting changes that were applied. Using Crisp, a programmer can
iteratively select, apply, and undo individual (or sets of) affecting
changes and, thus effectively find a small set of failure-inducing
changes.
