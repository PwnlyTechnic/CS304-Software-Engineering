<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The languages of current dynamic constraint detection techniques are often
specified by fixed grammars of universal properties. These properties may
not be sufficient to express more subtle facts that describe the essential
behavior of a given program. In an effort to make the dynamically
recovered specification more expressive and program-specific we propose
the state space partitioning technique as a solution which effectively
adds program-specific disjunctive properties to the language of dynamic
constraint detection. In this paper we present ContExt, a prototype
implementation of the state space partitioning technique which relies on
Daikon for dynamic constraint inference tasks. 
</p>

<p>
In order to evaluate recovered specifications produced by ContExt, we
develop a methodology which allows us to measure quantitatively how well a
particular recovered specification approximates the essential
specification of a program's behavior. The proposed methodology is then
used to comparatively evaluate the specifications recovered by ContExt and
Daikon on two examples.
