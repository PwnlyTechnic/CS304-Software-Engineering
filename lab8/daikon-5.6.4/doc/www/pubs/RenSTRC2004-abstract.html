<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper reports on the design and implementation of Chianti, a change
impact analysis tool for Java that is implemented in the context of the
Eclipse environment. Chianti analyzes two versions of an application and
decomposes their difference into a set of atomic changes. Change impact is
then reported in terms of affected (regression or unit) tests whose
execution behavior may have been modified by the applied changes. For each
affected test, Chianti also determines a set of affecting changes that
were responsible for the test's modified behavior. This latter step of
isolating the changes that induce the failure of one specific test from
those changes that only affect other tests can be used as a debugging
technique in situations where a test fails unexpectedly after a long
editing session. We evaluated Chianti on a year (2002) of CVS data from M.
Ernst's Daikon system, and found that, on average, 52% of Daikon's unit
tests are affected. Furthermore, each affected unit test, on average, is
affected by only 3.95% of the atomic changes. These findings suggest that
our change impact analysis is a promising technique for assisting
developers with program understanding and debugging.
