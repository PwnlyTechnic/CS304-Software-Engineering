<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A <var>raw</var> object is partially initialized, with only some fields
set to legal values. It may violate its object invariants, such as that a
given field is non-<code>null</code>. Programs often manipulate
partially-initialized objects, but they must do so with care. Furthermore,
analyses must be aware of field initialization. For instance, proving the
absence of null pointer dereferences or of division by zero, or proving
that object invariants are satisfied, requires information about
initialization. 
</p>

<p>
We present a static analysis that infers a safe over-approximation of the
program variables, fields, and array elements that, at run time, might
hold raw objects. Our formalization is flow-sensitive and interprocedural,
and it considers the exception flow in the analyzed program. We have
proved the analysis sound and implemented it in a tool called Julia that
computes initialization and nullness information. We have evaluated Julia
on over 160K lines of code. We have compared its output to
manually-written initialization and nullness information, and to an
independently-written type-checking tool that checks initialization and
nullness. Julia's output is accurate and useful both to programmers and to
static analyses.
