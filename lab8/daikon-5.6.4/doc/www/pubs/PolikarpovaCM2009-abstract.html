<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Where do contracts  &mdash;  specification elements embedded in executable
code  &mdash;  come from? To produce them, should we rely on the
programmers, on automatic tools, or some combination? 
</p>

<p>
Recent work, in particular the Daikon system, has shown that it is
possible to infer some contracts automatically from program executions.
The main incentive has been an assumption that most programmers are
reluctant to invent the contracts themselves. The experience of
contract-supporting languages, notably Eiffel, disproves that assumption:
programmers will include contracts if given the right tools. That
experience also shows, however, that the resulting contracts are generally
partial and occasionally incorrect. 
</p>

<p>
Contract inference tools provide the opportunity for studying objectively
the quality of programmer-written contracts, and for assessing the
respective roles of humans and tools. Working on 25 classes taken from
different sources such as widely-used standard libraries and code written
by students, we applied Daikon to infer contracts and compared the results
(totaling more than 19500 inferred assertion clauses) with the already
present contracts. 
</p>

<p>
We found that a contract inference tool can be used to strengthen
programmer-written contracts, but cannot infer all contracts that humans
write. The tool generates around five times as many relevant assertion
clauses as written by programmers; but it only finds around 60% of those
originally written by programmers. Around a third of the generated
assertions clauses are either incorrect or irrelevant. The study also
uncovered interesting correlations between the quality of inferred
contracts and some code metrics.
