<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The general technique for dynamically detecting likely invariants, as
implemented by Daikon, lacks specific object-oriented support for
polymorphism. Daikon examines only the declared type of a variable which
prohibits it from examination of the runtime variables in the presence of
polymorphism. The approach presented in this paper extends the technique
to consider the runtime type of a polymorphic variable, which may have
different declared and runtime types. The runtime behavior of a
polymorphic variable is captured by <var>polymorphic constraints</var>
which have the form of an implication with the name of the runtime class
in the antecedent. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of the dynamically
detected specification on the <code>Money</code> example from the JUnit
testing framework tutorial. Polymorphic constraints are shown to reveal
the specification of the runtime behavior of the example.
