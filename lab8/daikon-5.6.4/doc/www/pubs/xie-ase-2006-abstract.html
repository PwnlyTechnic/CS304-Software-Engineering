<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Unit testing, a common step in software development, presents a challenge.
When produced manually, unit test suites are often insufficient to
identify defects. The main alternative is to use one of a variety of
automatic unit-test generation tools: these are able to produce and
execute a large number of test inputs that extensively exercise the unit
under test. However, without a priori specifications, programmers need to
manually verify the outputs of these test executions, which is generally
impractical. To reduce this cost, unit-test selection techniques may be
used to help select a subset of automatically generated test inputs. Then
programmers can verify their outputs, equip them with test oracles, and
put them into the existing test suite. In this paper, we present the
operational violation approach for unit-test generation and selection, a
black-box approach without requiring a priori specifications. The approach
dynamically generates operational abstractions from executions of the
existing unit test suite. These operational abstractions guide test
generation tools to generate tests to violate them. The approach selects
those generated tests violating operational abstractions for inspection.
These selected tests exercise some new behavior that has not been
exercised by the existing tests. We implemented this approach by
integrating the use of Daikon (a dynamic invariant detection tool) and
Parasoft Jtest (a commercial Java unit testing tool), and conducted
several experiments to assess the approach.
