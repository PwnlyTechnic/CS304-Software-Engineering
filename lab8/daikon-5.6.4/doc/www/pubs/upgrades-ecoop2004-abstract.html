<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Previous work proposed a technique for predicting problems resulting from
replacing one version of a software component by another. The technique
reports, before performing the replacement or integrating the new
component into a system, whether the upgrade could be problematic for that
particular system. This paper extends the technique to make it more
applicable to real-world upgrades. First, we extend the theoretical
framework to handle more complex upgrades, including procedures that share
state, callbacks, and simultaneous upgrades of multiple components. The
old model is a special case of our new one. Second, we show how to handle
four real-world situations that were not addressed by previous work:
non-local state, non-determinism, distinguishing old from new
incompatibilities, and lack of test suites. Third, we present a case study
in which we upgrade the Linux C library, for 48 Unix programs. Our
implementation identified real incompatibilities among versions of the C
library that affected some of the programs, and it approved the upgrades
for other programs that were unaffected by the changes.
