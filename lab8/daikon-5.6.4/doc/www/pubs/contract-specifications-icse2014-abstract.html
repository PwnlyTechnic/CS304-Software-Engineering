<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Contracts are a popular tool for specifying the functional behavior of
software. This paper characterizes the contracts that developers write,
the contracts that developers could write, and how a developer reacts when
shown the difference. 
</p>

<p>
This paper makes three research contributions based on an investigation of
open-source projects' use of Code Contracts. First, we characterize Code
Contract usage in practice. For example, approximately three-fourths of
the Code Contracts are basic checks for the presence of data. We discuss
similarities and differences in usage across the projects, and we identify
annotation burden, tool support, and training as possible explanations
based on developer interviews. Second, based on contracts automatically
inferred for four of the projects, we find that developers underutilize
contracts for expressing state updates, object state indicators, and
conditional properties. Third, we performed user studies to learn how
developers decide which contracts to enforce. The developers used contract
suggestions to support their existing use cases with more expressive
contracts. However, the suggestions did not lead them to experiment with
other use cases for which contracts are better-suited. 
</p>

<p>
In support of the research contributions, the paper presents two
engineering contributions: (1) Celeriac, a tool for generating traces of
.NET programs compatible with the Daikon invariant detection tool, and (2)
Contract Inserter, a Visual Studio add-in for discovering and inserting
likely invariants as Code Contracts.
