<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Daikon is an implementation of dynamic detection of likely invariants;
that is, the Daikon invariant detector reports likely program invariants.
An invariant is a property that holds at a certain point or points in a
program; these are often used in assert statements, documentation, and
formal specifications. Examples include being constant (<i>x = a</i>),
non-zero (<i>x &ne; 0</i>), being in a range (<i>a &le; x &le; b</i>),
linear relationships (<i>y = ax+b</i>), ordering (<i>x &le; y</i>),
functions from a library (<i>x = </i>fn<i>(y)</i>), containment (<i>x
&isin; y</i>), sortedness (<i>x </i>is<i> </i>sorted<i></i>), and many
more. Users can extend Daikon to check for additional invariants. 
</p>

<p>
Dynamic invariant detection runs a program, observes the values that the
program computes, and then reports properties that were true over the
observed executions. Dynamic invariant detection is a machine learning
technique that can be applied to arbitrary data. Daikon can detect
invariants in C, C + +, Java, and Perl programs, and in record-structured
data sources; it is easy to extend Daikon to other applications. 
</p>

<p>
Invariants can be useful in program understanding and a host of other
applications. Daikon's output has been used for generating test cases,
predicting incompatibilities in component integration, automating
theorem-proving, repairing inconsistent data structures, and checking the
validity of data streams, among other tasks.
