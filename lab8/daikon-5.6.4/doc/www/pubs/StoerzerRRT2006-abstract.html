<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Testing and code editing are interleaved activities during program
development. When tests fail unexpectedly, the changes that caused the
failure(s) are not always easy to find. We explore how change
classification can focus programmer attention on failure-inducing changes
by automatically labeling changes Red, Yellow, or Green, indicating the
likelihood that they have contributed to a test failure. We implemented
our change classification tool JUnit/CIA as an extension to the JUnit
component within Eclipse, and evaluated its effectiveness in two case
studies. Our results indicate that change classification is an effective
technique for finding failure-inducing changes.
