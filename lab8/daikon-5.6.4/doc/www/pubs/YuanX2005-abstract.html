<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Some requirement modelling languages such as UML's statechart diagrams
allow developers to specify requirements of state-transition behavior in a
visual way. These requirement specifications are useful in many ways,
including helping program understanding and specification-based testing.
However, there are a large number of legacy systems that are not equipped
with these requirement specifications. This paper proposes a new approach,
called Brastra, for extracting object state machines (OSM) from unit-test
executions. An OSM describes how a method call transits an object from one
state to another. When the state of an object is represented with
concrete-state information (the values of fields transitively reachable
from the object), the extracted OSMs are simply too complex to be useful.
Our Brastra approach abstracts an object's concrete state to an abstract
state based on the branch coverage information exercised by methods
invoked on the object. We have prototyped our Brastra approach and shown
the utility of the approach with an illustrating example. Our initial
experience shows that Brastra can extract compact OSMs that provide useful
information for understanding state-transition behavior.
