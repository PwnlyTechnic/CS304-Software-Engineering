<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
During program maintenance, a programmer may make changes that enhance
program functionality or fix bugs in code. Then, the programmer usually
will run unit/regression tests to prevent invalidation of previously
tested functionality. If a test fails unexpectedly, the programmer needs
to explore the edit to find the failure-inducing changes for that test.
Crisp uses results from Chianti, a tool that performs semantic change
impact analysis [1], to allow the programmer to examine those parts of the
edit that affect the failing test. Crisp then builds a compilable
intermediate version of the program by adding a programmer-selected
partial edit to the original code, augmenting the selection as necessary
to ensure compilation. The programmer can reexecute the test on the
intermediate version in order to locate the exact reasons for the failure
by concentrating on the specific changes that were applied. In nine
initial case studies on pairs of versions from two real Java programs,
Daikon [2] and Eclipse jdt compiler [3], we were able to use Crisp to
identify the failure-inducing changes for all but 1 of 68 failing tests.
On average, 33 changes were found to affect each failing test (of the 67),
but only 1-4 of these changes were found to be actually failure-inducing.
