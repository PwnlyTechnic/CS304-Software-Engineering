<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
<var>Test factoring</var> creates fast, focused unit tests from slow system-wide tests; each new unit test exercises only a subset of the functionality exercised by the system test. Augmenting a test suite with factored unit tests should catch errors earlier in a test run. 
</p>

<p>
One way to factor a test is to introduce <var>mock objects</var>. If a
test exercises a component T, which interacts with another component E
(the &#8220;environment&#8221;), the implementation of E can be replaced
by a <var>mock</var>. The mock checks that T's calls to E are as expected,
and it simulates E's behavior in response. We introduce an automatic
technique for test factoring. Given a system test for T and E, and a
record of T's and E's behavior when the system test is run, test factoring
generates unit tests for T in which E is mocked. The factored tests can
isolate bugs in T from bugs in E and, if E is slow or expensive, improve
test performance or cost. 
</p>

<p>
Our implementation of automatic dynamic test factoring for the Java
language reduces the running time of a system test suite by up to an order
of magnitude.
