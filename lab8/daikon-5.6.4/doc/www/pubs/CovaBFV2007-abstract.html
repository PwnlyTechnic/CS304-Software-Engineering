<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In recent years, web applications have become tremendously popular, and
nowadays they are routinely used in security-critical environments, such
as medical, financial, and military systems. As the use of web
applications for critical services has increased, the number and
sophistication of attacks against these applications have grown as well.
Most approaches to the detection of web-based attacks analyze the
interaction of a web application with its clients and back-end servers.
Even though these approaches can effectively detect and block a number of
attacks, there are attacks that cannot be detected only by looking at the
external behavior of a web application. 
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we present Swaddler, a novel approach to the anomaly-based
detection of attacks against web applications. Swaddler analyzes the
internal state of a web application and learns the relationships between
the application's critical execution points and the application's internal
state. By doing this, Swaddler is able to identify attacks that attempt to
bring an application in an inconsistent, anomalous state, such as
violations of the intended workflow of a web application. We developed a
prototype of our approach for the PHP language and we evaluated it with
respect to several real-world applications.
