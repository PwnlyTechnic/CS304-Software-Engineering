<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Computer systems are often difficult to debug and understand. A common way
of gaining insight into system behavior is to inspect execution logs and
documentation. Unfortunately, manual inspection of logs is an arduous
process and documentation is often incomplete and out of sync with the
implementation. 
</p>

<p>
This paper presents <var>Synoptic</var>, a tool that helps developers by
inferring a concise and accurate system model. Unlike most related work,
Synoptic does not require developer-written scenarios, specifications,
negative execution examples, or other complex user input. Synoptic
processes the logs most systems already produce and requires developers
only to specify a set of regular expressions for parsing the logs. 
</p>

<p>
Synoptic has two unique features. First, the model it produces satisfies
temporal invariants mined from the logs, improving accuracy over related
approaches. Second, Synoptic uses refinement and coarsening to explore the
model space. This improves model efficiency and precision, compared to
using just one approach. 
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we formally prove that Synoptic always produces a model
that satisfies exactly the temporal invariants that hold in the log, and
we argue that it does so efficiently. We empirically evaluate Synoptic
through two user experience studies, one with a developer of a large,
real-world system and another with 45 students in a distributed systems
course. Developers used Synoptic-generated models to verify known bugs,
diagnose new bugs, and increase their confidence in the correctness of
their systems. None of the developers in our evaluation had a background
in formal methods but were able to easily use Synoptic and detect
implementation bugs in as little as a few minutes.
