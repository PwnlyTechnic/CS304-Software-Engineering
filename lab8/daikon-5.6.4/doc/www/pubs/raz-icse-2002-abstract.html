<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Much of the software we use for everyday purposes incorporates elements
developed and maintained by someone other than the developer. These
elements include not only code and databases but also dynamic data feeds
from online data sources. Although everyday software is not mission
critical, it must be dependable enough for practical use. This is limited
by the dependability of the incorporated elements.It is particularly
difficult to evaluate the dependability of dynamic data feeds, because
they may be changed by their proprietors as they are used. Further, the
specifications of these data feeds are often even sketchier than the
specifications of software components.We demonstrate a method of inferring
invariants about the normal behavior of dynamic data feeds. We use these
invariants as proxies for specifications to perform on-going detection of
anomalies in the data feed. We show the feasibility of our approach and
demonstrate its usefulness for semantic anomaly detection: identifying
occasions when a dynamic data feed is delivering unreasonable values, even
though its behavior may be superficially acceptable (i.e., it is
delivering parsable results in a timely fashion).
