<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Enterprise systems must guarantee high availability and reliability to
provide 24/7 services without interruptions and failures. Mechanisms for
handling exceptional cases and implementing fault tolerance techniques can
reduce failure occurrences, and increase dependability. Most of such
mechanisms address major problems that lead to unexpected service
termination or crashes, but do not deal with many subtle domain dependent
failures that do not necessarily cause service termination or crashes, but
result in incorrect results. 
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we propose a technique for developing self-protecting
systems. The technique proposed in this paper observes values at relevant
program points. When the technique detects a software failure, it uses the
collected information to identify the execution contexts that lead to the
failure, and automatically enables mechanisms for preventing future
occurrences of failures of the same type. Thus, failures do not occur
again after the first detection of a failure of the same type.
