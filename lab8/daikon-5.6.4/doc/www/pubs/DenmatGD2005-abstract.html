<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A program invariant is a property that holds for every execution of the
program. Recent work suggest to infer likely-only invariants, via dynamic
analysis. A likely invariant is a property that holds for some executions
but is not guaranteed to hold for all executions. In this paper, we
present work in progress addressing the challenging problem of
automatically verifying that likely invariants are actual invariants. We
propose a constraint-based reasoning approach that is able, unlike other
approaches, to both prove or disprove likely invariants. In the latter
case, our approach provides counter-examples. We illustrate the approach
on a motivating example where automatically generated likely invariants
are verified.
