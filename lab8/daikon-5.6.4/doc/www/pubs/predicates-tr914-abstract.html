<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This research proposes and evaluates techniques for selecting predicates
for conditional program properties  &mdash;  that is, implications such as
<i>p &rArr; q</i> whose consequent must be true whenever the predicate is
true. Conditional properties are prevalent in recursive data structures,
which behave differently in their base and recursive cases, in programs
that contain branches, in programs that fail only on some inputs, and in
many other situations. The experimental context of the research is dynamic
detection of likely program invariants, but the ideas are applicable to
other domains. 
</p>

<p>
Trying every possible predicate for conditional properties is
computationally infeasible and yields too many undesirable properties.
This paper compares four policies for selecting predicates: procedure
return analysis, code conditionals, clustering, and random selection. It
also shows how to improve predicates via iterated analysis. An
experimental evaluation demonstrates that the techniques improve
performance on two tasks: statically proving the absence of run-time
errors with a theorem-prover, and separating faulty from correct
executions of erroneous programs.
