<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The use of invariants during software development has many advantages.
Among other things, invariants can be used to formally specify programs,
to check certain vital properties at run-time, improve communication
between programmers and make understanding programs easier. Despite these
advantages, many programs lack explicit invariants. Dynamic invariant
generation can automatically derive invariants from the program source but
needs an initial test suite. Moreover, the quality of the generated
invariants depends on this initial test suite. Many programs have test
suites for detecting errors which are designed according to structural
coverage criteria. In order to reuse these test suites for invariant
generation, we must investigate the ability of structural coverage
criteria to produce good quality invariants. An experiment was setup to
investigate this ability. Our results indicate that there is indeed a
correlation between structural coverage criteria and the quality of the
generated invariants, but that in some cases this correlation can become
weak due to other factors.
