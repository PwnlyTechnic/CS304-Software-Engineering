<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Dynamic invariant detection is the identification of the likely properties
about a program based on observed variable values during program
execution. While other dynamic invariant detectors use a brute force
algorithm, Daikon adds powerful optimizations to provide more scalable
invariant detection without sacrificing the richness of the reported
invariants. Daikon improves scalability by eliminating redundant
invariants. For example, the suppression optimization allows Daikon to
delay the creation of invariants that are logically implied by other true
invariants. Although conceptually simple, the implementation of this
optimization in Daikon has a large fixed cost and scales polynomially with
the number of program variables. 
</p>

<p>
I investigated performance problems in two implementations of the
suppression optimization in Daikon and evaluated several methods for
improving the algorithm for the suppression optimization: optimizing
existing algorithms, using a hybrid, context-sensitive approach to
maximize the effectiveness of the two algorithms, and batching
applications of the algorithm to lower costs. Experimental results showed
a 10% runtime improvement in Daikon runtime. In addition, I implemented an
oracle to verify the implementation of these improvements and the other
optimizations in Daikon.
