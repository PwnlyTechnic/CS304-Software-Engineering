<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A component-based software system consists of well-encapsulated components
that interact with each other via their interfaces. Software integration
tests are generated to test the interactions among different components.
These tests are usually in the form of sequences of interface method
calls. Although many components are equipped with documents that provide
informal specifications of individual interface methods, few documents
specify component interaction constraints on the usage of these interface
methods, including the order in which these methods should be called and
the constraints on the method arguments and returns across multiple
methods. In this paper, we propose Substra, a framework for automatic
generation of software integration tests based on call-sequence
constraints inferred from dynamic executions. Two types of sequencing
constraints are inferred: shared subsystem states and object define-use
relationships. The inferred constraints are used to guide automatic
generation of integration tests. We have implemented Substra with a tool
and applied the tool on an ATM example. The preliminary results show that
the tool can effectively generate integration tests that exercise new
program behaviors.
