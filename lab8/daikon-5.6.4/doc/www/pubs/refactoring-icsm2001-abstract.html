<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Program refactoring  &mdash;  transforming a program to improve
readability, structure, performance, abstraction, maintainability, or
other characteristics  &mdash;	is not applied in practice as much as
might be desired. One deterrent is the cost of detecting candidates for
refactoring and of choosing the appropriate refactoring transformation.
This paper demonstrates the feasibility of automatically finding places in
the program that are candidates for specific refactorings. The approach
uses program invariants: when particular invariants hold at a program
point, a specific refactoring is applicable. Since most programs lack
explicit invariants, an invariant detection tool called Daikon is used to
infer the required invariants. We developed an invariant pattern matcher
for several common refactorings and applied it to an existing Java code
base. Numerous refactorings were detected, and one of the developers of
the code base assessed their efficacy.
