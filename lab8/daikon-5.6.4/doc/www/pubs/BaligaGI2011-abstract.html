<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Rootkits affect system security by modifying kernel data structures to
achieve a variety of malicious goals. While early rootkits modified
control data structures, such as the system call table and values of
function pointers, recent work has demonstrated rootkits that maliciously
modify noncontrol data. Most prior techniques for rootkit detection have
focused solely on detecting control data modifications and, therefore,
fail to detect such rootkits. This paper presents a novel technique to
detect rootkits that modify both control and noncontrol data. The main
idea is to externally observe the execution of the kernel during an
inference phase and hypothesize invariants on kernel data structures. A
rootkit detection phase uses these invariants as specifications of data
structure integrity. During this phase, violation of invariants indicates
an infection. We have implemented Gibraltar, a prototype tool that infers
kernel data structure invariants and uses them to detect rootkits.
Experiments show that Gibraltar can effectively detect previously known
rootkits, including those that modify noncontrol data structures.
