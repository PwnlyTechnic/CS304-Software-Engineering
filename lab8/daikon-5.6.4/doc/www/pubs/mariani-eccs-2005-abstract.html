<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Component-based technology is increasingly adopted to speed up the
development of complex software through component reuse. Unfortunately,
the lack of complete information about reused components, and the complex
interaction patterns among components can lead to subtle problems that
throw new verification challenges. Good components are often re-used many
times, sometimes within product lines, in other cases across different
products. The reuse of components provides a lot of information that could
be useful for verification. In this paper, we show how to automatically
analyze component interactions by collecting information about components'
behavior during testing and field execution, and then using the collected
information for checking the compatibility of components when updated or
reused in new products. The paper illustrates the main problems in
developing the idea, proposes original solutions, and presents a
preliminary experience that illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.
