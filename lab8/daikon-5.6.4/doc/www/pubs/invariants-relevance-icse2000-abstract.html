<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Explicitly stated program invariants can help programmers by
characterizing certain aspects of program execution and identifying
program properties that must be preserved when modifying code.
Unfortunately, these invariants are usually absent from code. Previous
work showed how to dynamically detect invariants from program traces by
looking for patterns in and relationships among variable values. A
prototype implementation, Daikon, accurately recovered invariants from
formally-specified programs, and the invariants it detected in other
programs assisted programmers in a software evolution task. However,
Daikon suffered from reporting too many invariants, many of which were not
useful, and also failed to report some desired invariants. 
</p>

<p>
This paper presents, and gives experimental evidence of the efficacy of,
four approaches for increasing the relevance of invariants reported by a
dynamic invariant detector. One of them  &mdash;  exploiting unused
polymorphism  &mdash;  adds desired invariants to the output. The other
three  &mdash;	suppressing implied invariants, limiting which variables
are compared to one another, and ignoring unchanged values  &mdash; 
eliminate undesired invariants from the output and also improve runtime by
reducing the work done by the invariant detector.
