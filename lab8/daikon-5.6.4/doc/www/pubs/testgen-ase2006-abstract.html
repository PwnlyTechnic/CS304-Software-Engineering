<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Testing involves two major activities: generating test inputs and
determining whether they reveal faults. Automated test generation
techniques include random generation and symbolic execution. Automated
test classification techniques include ones based on uncaught exceptions
and violations of operational models inferred from manually provided
tests. Previous research on unit testing for object-oriented programs
developed three pairs of these techniques: model-based random testing,
exception-based random testing, and exception-based symbolic testing. We
develop a novel pair, model-based symbolic testing. We also empirically
compare all four pairs of these generation and classification techniques.
The results show that the pairs are complementary (i.e., reveal faults
differently), with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
