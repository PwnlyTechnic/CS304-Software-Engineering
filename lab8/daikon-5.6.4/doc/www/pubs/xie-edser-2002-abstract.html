<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Software quality assurance (SQA) plays a key role in software development
process. Software quality assurance methods include testing, inspection,
formal method (program verification, model checking, etc.), static code
analysis, and runtime verification, etc. A disciplined approach to meeting
benefit, cost, schedule, and quality constraints is in need. In this
paper, we propose two perspectives (macro and micro) on strategic software
quality assurance in resource constrained environments. We present a
survey and discuss a variety of research opportunities and challenges with
these two perspectives. Finally we present our research work on test case
prioritization based on boundary value coverage to tackle strategic SQA
problems with these two perspectives.
