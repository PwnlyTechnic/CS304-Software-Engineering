<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This dissertation introduces dynamic detection of program invariants,
presents techniques for detecting such invariants from traces, assesses
the techniques' efficacy, and points the way for future research. 
</p>

<p>
Invariants are valuable in many aspects of program development, including
design, coding, verification, testing, optimization, and maintenance. They
also enhance programmers' understanding of data structures, algorithms,
and program operation. Unfortunately, explicit invariants are usually
absent from programs, depriving programmers and automated tools of their
benefits. 
</p>

<p>
This dissertation shows how invariants can be dynamically detected from
program traces that capture variable values at program points of interest.
The user runs the target program over a test suite to create the traces,
and an invariant detector determines which properties and relationships
hold over both explicit variables and other expressions. Properties that
hold over the traces and also satisfy other tests, such as being
statistically justified, not being over unrelated variables, and not being
implied by other reported invariants, are reported as likely invariants.
Like other dynamic techniques such as testing, the quality of the output
depends in part on the comprehensiveness of the test suite. If the test
suite is inadequate, then the output indicates how, permitting its
improvement. Dynamic analysis complements static techniques, which can be
made sound but for which certain program constructs remain beyond the
state of the art. 
</p>

<p>
Experiments demonstrate a number of positive qualities of dynamic
invariant detection and of a prototype implementation, Daikon. Invariant
detection is accurate  &mdash;	it rediscovers formal specifications 
&mdash;  and useful  &mdash;  it assists programmers in programming tasks.
It runs quickly and produces output of modest size. Test suites found in
practice tend to be adequate for dynamic invariant detection.
