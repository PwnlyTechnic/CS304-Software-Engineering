<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper describes practical experience building and using pluggable
type-checkers. A pluggable type-checker refines (strengthens) the built-in
type system of a programming language. This permits programmers to detect
and prevent, at compile time, defects that would otherwise have been
manifested as run-time errors. The prevented defects may be generally
applicable to all programs, such as null pointer dereferences. Or, an
application-specific pluggable type system may be designed for a single
application. 
</p>

<p>
We built a series of pluggable type checkers using the Checker Framework,
and evaluated them on 2 million lines of code, finding hundreds of bugs in
the process. We also observed 28 first-year computer science students use
a checker to eliminate null pointer errors in their course projects. 
</p>

<p>
Along with describing the checkers and characterizing the bugs we found,
we report the insights we had throughout the process. Overall, we found
that the type checkers were easy to write, easy for novices to
productively use, and effective in finding real bugs and verifying program
properties, even for widely tested and used open source projects.
