<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Complex software systems are seldom designed from scratch; rather they are
often designed by assembling basic components. Software tools are not an
exception: They are often obtained by assembling simple tools that provide
basic functionality. From the verification viewpoint, basic tools do not
differ from components: in both cases they can be seen as black box
elements that provide a set of services for the embedding system or tool.
Complex systems and tools are often provided in many different versions
and configurations that are obtained by adding and replacing various
components. Let us consider for example a complex CASE tool that runs on
several platforms and is distributed in various versions for different
user profiles. Many graphics and system components may be used for
distinct platforms. For instance, the simple configurations distributed
free-of-charge may include only a simple set of basic tools, while the
educational and the professional editions may include a wider set of basic
tools that provide extended functionality. Unfortunately, behavioral
differences among components may cause subtle failures difficult to reveal
and remove. On of the main goals of verification is to check the
completeness and compatibility of the services provided by the components
to reveal possible conflicts, thus supporting efficient verification of
different tool configurations and versions.
