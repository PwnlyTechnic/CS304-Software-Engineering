<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Dynamic invariant detection is an approach that has received considerable
attention in the recent research literature. A natural question arises in
languages that separate the interface of a code module from its
implementation: does an inferred invariant describe the interface or the
implementation? Furthermore, if an implementation is allowed to refine
another, as, for instance, in object-oriented method overriding, what is
the relation between the inferred invariants of the overriding and the
overridden method? The problem is of great practical interest. Invariants
derived by real tools, like Daikon, often suffer from internal
inconsistencies when overriding is taken into account, becoming unsuitable
for some automated uses. We discuss the interactions between overriding
and inferred invariants, and describe the implementation of an invariant
inference tool that produces consistent invariants for interfaces and
overridden methods.
