<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The development of COTS-based systems shifts the focus of testing and
verification from single components to component integration. Independent
teams and organizations develop COTS components without referring to
specific systems or interaction patterns. Developing systems that reuse
COTS components (even high-quality ones) therefore presents new
compatibility problems. David Garlan, Robert Allen, and John Ockerbloom
(1995) reported that in their experience, integrating four COTS components
took 10 person-years (rather than the one planned person-year), mainly
because of integration problems. According to Barry Boehm and Chris Abts
(1999), three of the four main problems with reusing COTS products are
absence of control over their functionality, absence of control over their
evolution, and lack of design for interoperability. Our proposed
technique, called behavior capture and test, detects COTS component
incompatibilities by dynamically analyzing component behavior. BCT
incrementally builds behavioral models of components and compares them
with the behavior the components display when reused in new contexts. This
lets us identify incompatibilities, unexpected interactions, untested
behaviors, and dangerous side effects.
