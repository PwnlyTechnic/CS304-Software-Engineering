<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Dynamically discovering likely program invariants from concrete test
executions has emerged as a highly promising software engineering
technique. Dynamic invariant inference has the advantage of succinctly
summarizing both &#8220;expected&#8221; program inputs and the subset of
program behaviors that is normal under those inputs. In this paper, we
introduce a technique that can drastically increase the relevance of
inferred invariants, or reduce the size of the test suite required to
obtain good invariants. Instead of falsifying invariants produced by
pre-set patterns, we determine likely program invariants by combining the
concrete execution of actual test cases with a simultaneous symbolic
execution of the same tests. The symbolic execution produces abstract
conditions over program variables that the concrete tests satisfy during
their execution. In this way, we obtain the benefits of dynamic inference
tools like Daikon: the inferred invariants correspond to the observed
program behaviors. At the same time, however, our inferred invariants are
much more suited to the program at hand than Daikon's hard-coded invariant
patterns. The symbolic invariants are literally derived from the program
text itself, with appropriate value substitutions as dictated by symbolic
execution. We implemented our technique in the DySy tool, which utilizes a
powerful symbolic execution and simplification engine. The results confirm
the benefits of our approach. In Daikon's prime example benchmark, we
infer the majority of the interesting Daikon invariants, while eliminating
invariants that a human user is likely to consider irrelevant.
