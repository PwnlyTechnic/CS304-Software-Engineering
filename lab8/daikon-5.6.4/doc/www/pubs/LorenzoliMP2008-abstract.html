<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Dynamic analysis of software systems produces behavioral models that are
useful for analysis, verification and testing. 
</p>

<p>
The main techniques for extracting models of functional behavior generate
either models of constraints on data, usually in the form of Boolean
expressions, or models of interactions between components, usually in the
form of finite state machines. Both data and interaction models are useful
for analyzing and verifying different aspects of software behavior, but
none of them captures the complex interplay between data values and
components interactions. Thus related analysis and testing techniques can
miss important information. 
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we focus on the generation of models of relations between
data values and component interactions, and we present GK-tail, a
technique to automatically generate extended finite state machines (EFSMs)
from interaction traces. EFSMs model the interplay between data values and
component interactions by annotating FSM edges with conditions on data
values. We show that EFSMs include details that are not captured by either
Boolean expressions or (classic) FSM alone, and allow for more accurate
analysis and verification than separate models, even if considered
jointly.
