<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Current trends in the embedded and real-time software industry are leading
towards the use of object-oriented programming languages such as Java.
From the software engineering perspective, one of the most attractive
issues in object-oriented design is the encapsulation of abstractions into
objects that communicate through clearly defined interfaces. 
</p>

<p>
However, in order to be able to successfully adopt languages with object
oriented features like Java in embedded and real-time systems, is
necessary to solve at least two problems: eliminate execution
unpredictability due to garbage collection and automatically analyze
memory requirements. 
</p>

<p>
There has been some work trying to deal with the first problem but the
problem of computing memory requirements is still challenging. In this
thesis we present our approach to tackle both problems by presenting
solutions towards more predictable memory management and predicting memory
requirements. The effort is mainly focused in the latter problem as we
found it hard, less explored, strongly relevant for all kinds of embedded
systems and its applicability and usefulness is beyond real-time
applications. 
</p>

<p>
This thesis presents a series of techniques to automatically compute
dynamic memory utilization certificates. We start by computing a technique
that produces parametric specifications of memory allocations without
consider any memory reclaiming mechanism. Then, we approximate object
lifetime using escape analysis and synthesize a scoped-based memory
organization where object are organized in regions that can be collected
as a whole. We propose a technique to automatically translate conventional
Java code into code that safely adopts this memory management mechanism.
Under this new setting we infer parametric specifications of the size of
each memory regions. Finally, we predict the minimum amount of dynamic
memory required to run a method (or program) in the context of scoped
memory management by computing parametric specifications of the size of
memory regions and by modeling the potential configurations of the regions
in run time. 
</p>

<p>
We develop a prototype tool that implemented the complete chain of
techniques and allow us to experimentally evaluate the efficiency and
accuracy of the method on several Java benchmarks. The results are very
encouraging.
