<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
An understanding of how software is employed in the field can yield many
opportunities for quality improvements. Profiling released software can
provide such an understanding. However, profiling released software is
difficult due to the potentially large number of deployed sites that must
be profiled, the transparency requirements at a user's site, and the
remote data collection and deployment management process. Researchers have
recently proposed various approaches to tap into the opportunities offered
by profiling deployed systems and overcome those challenges. Initial
studies have illustrated the application of these approaches and have
shown their feasibility. Still, the proposed approaches, and the tradeoffs
between overhead, accuracy, and potential benefits for the testing
activity have been barely quantified. This paper aims to overcome those
limitations. Our analysis of 1,200 user sessions on a 155 KLOC deployed
system substantiates the ability of field data to support test suite
improvements, assesses the efficiency of profiling techniques for released
software, and the effectiveness of testing efforts that leverage profiled
field data.
