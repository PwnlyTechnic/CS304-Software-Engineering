<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A common assumption made in log analysis research is that the underlying
log is totally ordered. For concurrent systems, this assumption constrains
the generated log to either exclude concurrency altogether, or to capture
a particular interleaving of concurrent events. This paper argues that
capturing concurrency as a partial order is useful and often indispensable
for answering important questions about concurrent systems. To this end,
we motivate a family of event ordering invariants over partially ordered
event traces, give three algorithms for mining these invariants from logs,
and evaluate their scalability on simulated distributed system logs.
