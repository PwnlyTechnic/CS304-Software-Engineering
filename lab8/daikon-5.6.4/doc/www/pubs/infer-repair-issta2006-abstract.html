<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Corrupt data structures are an important cause of unacceptable program
execution. Data structure repair (which eliminates inconsistencies by
updating corrupt data structures to conform to consistency constraints)
promises to enable many programs to continue to execute acceptably in the
face of otherwise fatal data structure corruption errors. A key issue is
obtaining an accurate and comprehensive data structure consistency
specification. 
</p>

<p>
We present a new technique for obtaining data structure consistency
specifications for data structure repair. Instead of requiring the
developer to manually generate such specifications, our approach
automatically generates candidate data structure consistency properties
using the Daikon invariant detection tool. The developer then reviews
these properties, potentially rejecting or generalizing overly specific
properties to obtain a specification suitable for automatic enforcement
via data structure repair. 
</p>

<p>
We have implemented this approach and applied it to three sizable
benchmark programs: CTAS (an air-traffic control system), BIND (a
widely-used Internet name server) and Freeciv (an interactive game). Our
results indicate that (1) automatic constraint generation produces
constraints that enable programs to execute successfully through data
structure consistency errors, (2) compared to manual specification,
automatic generation can produce more comprehensive sets of constraints
that cover a larger range of data structure consistency properties, and
(3) reviewing the properties is relatively straightforward and requires
substantially less programmer effort than manual generation, primarily
because it reduces the need to examine the program text to understand its
operation and extract the relevant consistency constraints. Moreover, when
evaluated by a hostile third party &#8220;Red Team&#8221; contracted to
evaluate the effectiveness of the technique, our data structure inference
and enforcement tools successfully prevented several otherwise fatal
attacks.
